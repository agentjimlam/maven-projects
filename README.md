simple-crm-v1 = after lesson 3.11
simple-crm-v2 = after lesson 3.12
simple-crm-before-3.14 = after lesson 3.13
simple-crm-lesson-3.14 = lesson 3.14
simple-crm-git-issue = DO NOT USE, stuck in loop when Activating Java Project due to duplicate files

I had to redo simple-crm lesson 3.14 due to a git issue. Renamed simple-crm to simple-crm-git-issue. The git issue was I did a 'git add .' previously and it tracked my moving of files to the controller service repository folders but didn't track it as renaming, so it ended up duplicating my files. This led to VScode stuck in a loop when Activating Java Project, it can't find the project.
